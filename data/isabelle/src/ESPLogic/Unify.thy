  Strategy: Per theorem

     1. check that it is an unconditional equality
     2. rewrite using current simpset
     3. if false then stop and return theorem false
        otherwise split conjunctions and add to 
        current simpset

   NOTE: We have to maintain the invariant that the simpset
         is non-looping. Hence, we may have to rebuild it several 
         times. Probably whenever a thread identifier equality 
         occurs.
